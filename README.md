# Purpose
I want to build my own version of Redis! This repository holds the code for that.

## Why Redis?
It's quite useful for caching! If you have very slow database queries that you run frequently, you can use Redis to store the data in a cache. Next time you need the result of that slow query, it comes out very quickly! Although I've never applied Redis to a project before, I'm hoping that this introduction will not only sharpen my network, data structure, low level, and database skills, but also give me appreciation for Redis and get me to use it.
