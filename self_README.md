The Linux VM you're running to develop Redis using C++ is called myredis. To run it, run the following command:
tart run myredis

# Recommended run
To run the vm with GUI, run this command
tart run --graphics myredis

# Useful guide if you forget your admin login details. Also good for spinning up VMs quickly
